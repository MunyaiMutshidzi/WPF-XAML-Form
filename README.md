A basic XAML project built 2 years ago (2022).
During my 2nd year at the University Of The Free State.
The Program uses both Back-end development using C# to create a class.
And uses the Front-End XAML for the layout and design, the application 
allows users to enter their details and click on Login and a dialog will appear with the filled in information.
